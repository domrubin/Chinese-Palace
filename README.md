# Chinese-Palace
This project was created as a test of modular design. After some contemplation, our team decided to create an ancient Chinese throne room using similar room pieces that scale the room up after repetitive use. A major issue arose in the incoming assets for the project, as not all of the environmental artists followed the same size scale, and therefore a plethora ofrecieved objects and modules were not scaled correctly with each other. This led to an extended period of time being spent on rescaling before the assets could be used, and I learned to be aware of the assets I recieved before they are finished and to advise fellow team members to follow preset guidelines. It was also a welcome introduction to First-Person camera control and modular assembly in Unity.
